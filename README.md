Project Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of Q1 2019 data from a bike-sharing company, with the primary objective of understanding the differences between annual members and casual riders. The ultimate goal is to provide recommendations for converting casual riders into annual members.

Data Cleaning
The initial dataset underwent comprehensive data cleaning, including the removal of null values, redundant columns, and the creation of additional columns for crucial calculations.

Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to gain insights into key differences between annual members and casual riders. This analysis covered various aspects, such as trip duration, average age, starting and ending trip locations, and more.

Tableau Dashboard
The findings from EDA were translated into an interactive Tableau dashboard, allowing for clear and visually appealing data visualization.
